# On writing well

## [William Zinsser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Zinsser) - 2016

- The essence of writing is rewriting
- Writing is a craft, not an art. Like a craftsman, you have to have a work routine to make sure you are expert at it.

### Simplify

Simplicity is key in a text, the text must avoid **disorders** and **approximations**. Therefore, overly complicated words that do not serve the purpose of clarity must be simplified.

You also have to avoid feelings: if you think an idea is interesting then you have to make it interesting. Without "I suppose, it could be, in my opinion" in your article.

Example of simplifying :

| Complicated                                          | Simple                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| I don't want to give my input and hear his feedback. | I want to give my ideas and hear what he thinks of them |

> Good writing is lean and confident.

Literature notes are the notes you take on the fly when you are reading a book, a blog post or listening to a podcast. With a pen and a paper next to you, you want to write with your own words what you understand of the read. The key feature here is that we want a much more active lecture and information consumption than just reading/listening. It may seem hard at first but once you take this habit, you feel almost disappointed reading without extracting what seems compelling.
