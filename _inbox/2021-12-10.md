Fleeting notes are your day-to-day notes. When an idea pops into your head or you find an idea interesting in a meeting, you want to write it to free your mental load. They are primarily the pool of new concepts.

Then comes the refinement of the notes. For this, you need to instigate a routine: clearing and deleting non-relevant paragraphs, extracting the ideas into concise notes. This routine is key to accumulate knowledge.

I suggest getting a note/file per day and starting the routine small: create a fleeting note each day but refine them only once a week.
